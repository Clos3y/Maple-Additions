MatrixRoot:=proc(n,r,A)
# v1.0

# n is the dimension of Matrix A, where A is a Complex nxn matrix with positive real eigenvalues
# r is the root you wish to take, with r in (0,1)

#Exception handling

for i from 1 to n do:

	if evalf(LinearAlgebra[Eigenvalues](A)[i])<0 then error "Negative eigenvalue; must be positive" else end if;

end do;

if 0>r or r>1 then error "Root invalid; must be in (0,1)" else end if;

# Beyond square-roots, this procedure tends to give results which are unevaluated sums in terms of RootOf_

sin(r*Pi)/(r*Pi) * A . map(int,((t^(1/r)*LinearAlgebra[IdentityMatrix](n) + A)^(-1),t=0..infinity))
